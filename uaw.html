  <h1>UAW Local Officer Survey Invitation</h1>

  <p>I’m pleased to invite you to participate in a survey of UAW local officers. The survey is for a research project to learn about issues affecting union locals like yours.</p>

  <p>The survey takes less than ten minutes. Your answers are confidential. The bottom of this webpage has answers to questions you might have.</p>

  <p><strong>We value your input.</strong> We contacted you because of your expertise and role in the UAW. The dollar bill is to thank you for your time.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your answers will help lawmakers, researchers, and the public better understand issues important to your union.</li>
    <li>We will also share early results with you, so you can learn what other locals like yours think about issues affecting the UAW.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can take the survey by entering the provided link into your web browser or by scanning the QR code.</p>

  <p>If you need a new link, please send me an email using the address below.</p>

  <p>Thank you,</p>

  <p>Alex Gazmararian<br>
  Ph.D. Student, Princeton University<br>
  Incoming Assistant Professor, University of Michigan<br>

  <h2>Why am I receiving this letter?</h2>
  <p>We are contacting UAW local officers because of their knowledge about the UAW. We value your views and hope you’ll consider participating.</p>

  <h2>Why are you interested in this research?</h2>
  <p>We’re interested because of the UAW’s importance for the economy and communities throughout the country.</p>
  <p>I also have a personal connection. My dad used to work at GM’s Milford Proving Grounds.</p>

  <h2>Where will the findings be shared?</h2>
  <p>We will first share a results summary with people who completed the survey. We will then submit the paper to academic journals and share findings with policymakers.</p>

  <h2>Should I take the survey if someone else at my local has already done it?</h2>
  <p>Yes. We’re hoping to survey all local officers—President, Vice President, Recording Secretary, Financial Secretary, Sergeant at Arms, Guide, Trustees—including local unit chairpeople.</p>

  <h2>What to do if I need help taking the survey?</h2>
  <p>The survey should be easy, but technical problems can happen. Please don’t hesitate to contact me at <a href="mailto:afg2@princeton.edu">afg2@princeton.edu</a>.</p>

  <h2>Who are you?</h2>
  <p>I’m a graduate student at Princeton University and an incoming Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan. Go Blue!</p>
